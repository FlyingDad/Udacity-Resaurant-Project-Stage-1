## Requirements
Browser capable of running ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
## Specification

## Dependencies  
- Google [Normalize Stylesheet](https://normalize-css.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/normalize.css) 
- Google Web Fundamentals: [Service Workers: an Introduction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/)
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), an open-source JavaScript library
for mobile-friendly interactive maps
- API key for [MapBox](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84)
- This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 


## Directions

1. You will need a local server running in order to run the app.

2. Open js/dbhelper.js and change line 12 to your local server port number.

3. If your IDE does not support live server, then you can run a local server by perfroming the following:

   - In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

   - With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
   - Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
   - Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
